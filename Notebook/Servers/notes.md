Background

- the number is a unique resource key generated on the client.
  The key can be time-generated, or it can be a hash of time, session ID, and some other factors to guarantee uniqueness of the value across your client audience. The server can then generate its own auto-incremented index, distinct from 10292829 or whatever.

# auto-incremented id

- issue with sequential id is that once you delete an item, it is no longer sequential

# UUUID

A universal unique identifier (UUID) is a standard of generating identifiers, standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF).

The intent of UUIDs is to be able to generate unique identifiers in a distributed system without central coordination point.

### Version 1 UUID

Version 1 UUID is meant for generating time-based UUIDs. They also accept 48 bit long identifier (281,474,976,710,655 available values). In many cases, it makes sense to use a machine MAC Address as an identifier. Sometimes if we use several UUID generators on the same system, we can use configured identifiers. Having a unique identifier in a distributed environment is critical. That will guarantee conflict-free ids.

### Version 4 UUID

Version 4 UUID is meant for generating UUIDs from truly-random or pseudo-random numbers. UUID v4 are not giving us guaranteed unique numbers; they are somewhat practically unique.

Probability of UUID v4 duplicates: Only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one duplicate would be about 50%.

Issues

- The problem with UUIDs is that they are very big in size and donâ€™t index well. When your dataset increases, the index size increases as well and the query performance takes a hit.

# shortid package

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid
- creates short non-sequential url-friendly unique ids. Perfect for url shorteners, MongoDB and Redis ids, and any other id users might see.

test

```
const shortid = require('shortid');

console.log(shortid.generate());
// PPBqWA9

```

use in my code :

````
users.insert({
  _id: shortid.generate(),
  name: '...',
  email: '...'
});
```* drawbacks : maybe a library like this is unnecccessary, I could create a similar version that is smaller
# hashids

https://www.npmjs.com/package/hashids

- similar to short id, but focused on the reverse lookup of a number
