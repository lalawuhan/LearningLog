# Learning Log

### Day 0: February 27, 2020 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Studied a data structure, created the log list and started my final project for the nanodegree

**Thoughts**: Cleaning up the CSS in the nanodegree was easy, and I am getting more practice with CSS Grid. Only thing that I am not so sure about is the right values to use for things like padding. em? rem? percentages? I need to look into this further. Decided to cover at least one data structure per week.

### Day 1: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We worked on the FS module in node, which provides useful functions to interact with the file system.

### Day 3: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today we worked on integrating the twitter api into our ticker project. I went to codebar in the evening and decided to build a small webpage that uses reddit json to display the top 100 posts from today I learnt subreddit.

**Thoughts** I underestimated my time in regards to blogging/logging during bootcamp. I want to be able to intergrate taking class notes and keeping track of my 'thinking pattern' when I am coding something.
