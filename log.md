**Today's Progress**: Placeholder

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: February 27, 2020 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Studied a data structure, created the log list and started my final project for the nanodegree

**Thoughts**: Cleaning up the CSS in the nanodegree was easy, and I am getting more practice with CSS Grid. Only thing that I am not so sure about is the right values to use for things like padding. em? rem? percentages? I need to look into this further. Decided to cover at least one data structure per week.

### Day 1: February 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We worked on the FS module in node, which provides useful functions to interact with the file system.


### Day 2: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We worked on the request module in node. 

**Thoughts** I really enjoyed with Postman again, I feel like it is such a lovely interface to use when handlingrequests and responses from the console.
I want to go back and work on a simple api to practice making more requests and responses, we should be using express soon so maybe I will do it then.
